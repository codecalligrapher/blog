      <title>Enforcing Function Implementation in Subclasses</title>

      <description>This is going to get very weird, very quickly. When you create a class in Python, it looks about like the following:
class MyClass: pass Now, let&amp;rsquo;s say I create some really cool class, with a set of cool functions, but I expect my users to implement some of the functions:
from abc import abstractmethod class BaseClass: @abstractmethod def foo(self,): raise NotImplementedError So the intention is, when my user inherits the above class, they do the following:</description>

      <title>Managed Attributes in Python</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I detailed how to maintain encapsulation using Python&amp;rsquo;s property. In this piece, I go through how/why to manage and apply validation to class attributes in an object-oriented fashion by means of a fairly plausible example.
A type is the parent class of class, therefore any class is actually a sub-type of type. The following are equivalent:
a = int(8) a = 8 type(a) # python knows to create an int without being explicit int The point of implementing custom attribute types is (in my case), for validation.</description>

      <description>If you ever created a class in Python, you probably accessed it using dot notation (i.e. instance_name.attribute_name).
That&amp;rsquo;s python&amp;rsquo;s way of calling getattr by means of an alias:
class A: var = 10 pass a = A() # this is how Python accesses attributes getattr(a, &#39;var&#39;) 10 a.__getattribute__(&#39;var&#39;) # above is an alias for this 10 The most &amp;ldquo;pythonic&amp;rdquo; way of getting and setting attributes is using dot notation:
A.var = 11 print(A.</description>

      <title>Using Decorators to Solve Date Problems</title>
      <link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/using-decorators-to-solve-data-cleaning/</link>

      <guid>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/using-decorators-to-solve-data-cleaning/</guid>
      <description>A decorator is the gateway drug into the world of Python metaprogramming. In python, everything, everything, is an object (specifically a dictionary but let&amp;rsquo;s not go there). That means that we can pass in and return any object regardless of its types, especially regardless of its type.
If I define a function:
def fn(*args, **kwargs): pass and now call type on fn
type(fn) function the type is function (No surprises there).</description>

      <title>Mapping Pandas Columns</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago I had to figure out how to perform a mapping of pandas column values to other values. This was not necessarily a discrete mapping, as in the initial column value needed to match a range.
The dataframe I was working with resembled the following:
value 0 88 1 3 2 5 3 65 4 72 5 54 And there were a set of conditions by which I needed to replace.</description>

      <title>Zero-Padding a CSV with AWK</title>

      <description>This was purely out of sheer need, and this was the fastest way I could&amp;rsquo;ve gotten it done (I ended up learning a LOT about CLI and the awk command from this, so I&amp;rsquo;m really grateful for that)
The problem: I have a column in a utf-8 CSV file of type Integer, which should actually be type string and zero-padded up to (let&amp;rsquo;s say length N).
~/projects/awk_pad ❯ cat out.csv a,Y,1 b,N,10 c,Y,12223253 What I want, is the following (output from the cat tool):</description>

      <description>This is taken from Diffusion Convolutional Neural Networks (referenced in the footer). According to the authors, a diffusion convolution scans a diffusion process across each node. Analog to biology, where the information is allowed to propagate conditional of its density and environment.
It was applied to node classification, edge classification and graph classification, but node-classification is the task I wanted to focus on. When first presented, it was a novel way to effectively apply convolutions (invariant to location and rotation), to arbitrarily-structured data (i.</description>

      <description>Origin Story Recently, I was trying to disect the original DCNN Paper which utilized a diffusion kernel to more readily make use of implicit graph-structure in common tasks such as node, edge and graph classification. However, an existing implementation I fonund had a curious piece of notation which led me down the rabbithole of Tensor calculus.
Coordinates are maps used to solve a given problem. A coordinate transform allows mapping from one frame of reference to another (converting from a map of your high school, to the location of your high school in reference to where it is in the city, compared to a country-wide map).</description>

      <title>Basics of The Adjacency Matrix</title>
      <link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/matrix-graph/</link>

      <description>This summarizes my initial set of basic notes surrounding the adjacency matrix representation of a graph
There are multiple ways of representing graph-structured data. One of the most common ways is using the adjacency matrix, where connections between nodes are represented in a row-column format.
For example:
$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} $$</description>

      <title>The Graph Neural Network</title>

      <description>The Graph Neural Network (GNN) was proposed (Scarselli, 2008) as a general framework for defining deep neural networks on graph data.
(If you need a refresher on deep learning, see here)
The idea was to somehow utilize a deep neural network to generate node-embeddings in a generalize-able way to graph-structured data. The main idea in utilizing neural networks was that, apart from node features (degree, attributes, etc), the actual structure of the node&amp;rsquo;s neighbourhood, and by extension the graph, should contribute somehow to the node embeddings.</description>

      <title>Prefetching Memory in CUDA</title>

      <description>Threads, Blocks and Grids A thread is a single &amp;ldquo;process&amp;rdquo; on GPU. Any given GPU kernel can use blocks of threads, grouped into a grid of blocks. A kernel is executed as a grid of blocks of threads. Each block is run by a single Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) and in most usual, single-node cases can&amp;rsquo;t be migrated to other SMs. One SM may execute several CUDA blocks concurrently.
Paging Paging is a memory-management technique which allows a process&amp;rsquo;s physical address space to be non-contiguous.</description>
