In python, everything, everything, is an object (specifically a dictionary but let&amp;rsquo;s not go there). That means that we can pass in and return any object regardless of its types, especially regardless of its type.
If I define a function:
def fn(*args, **kwargs): pass and now call type on fn
type(fn) function the type is function (No surprises there).</description></item><item><title>Mapping Pandas Columns</title><link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/conditional-replace-pandas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/conditional-replace-pandas/</guid><description>A few weeks ago I had to figure out how to perform a mapping of pandas column values to other values. This was not necessarily a discrete mapping, as in the initial column value needed to match a range.
The dataframe I was working with resembled the following:
value 0 88 1 3 2 5 3 65 4 72 5 54 And there were a set of conditions by which I needed to replace.</description></item><item><title>Parsing XML with untangle</title><link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/code/untangle-xml/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 06:38:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/code/untangle-xml/</guid><description>Given XML:

According to the authors, a diffusion convolution scans a diffusion process across each node. Analog to biology, where the information is allowed to propagate conditional of its density and environment.
It was applied to node classification, edge classification and graph classification, but node-classification is the task I wanted to focus on. When first presented, it was a novel way to effectively apply convolutions (invariant to location and rotation), to arbitrarily-structured data (i.</description></item><item><title>Sync Script</title><link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/code/sync-script/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 12:38:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/code/sync-script/</guid><description>#!/usr/bin/zsh while getopts a: flag do case &amp;#34;${flag}&amp;#34; in a) remote=${OPTARG};; esac done echo &amp;#34;remote IP: $remote&amp;#34;; echo &amp;#34;write: $final&amp;#34;; home_dir=&amp;#34;/home/aadi/&amp;#34; storage_dir=&amp;#34;/storage/&amp;#34; # files in home HomeArray=( &amp;#34;.zshrc&amp;#34; ) if [[ $* == *--write* ]] then for arr in $HomeArray; do rsync -Pvtau $home_dir$arr aadi@$remote:$home_dir$arr done else for arr in $HomeArray; do rsync -Pvntau $home_dir$arr aadi@$remote:$home_dir$arr done fi # folders in home HomeArray=( &amp;#34;.config/alacritty&amp;#34; &amp;#34;.config/qtile&amp;#34; &amp;#34;.config/nvim&amp;#34; ) if [[ $* == *--write* ]] then for arr in $HomeArray; do rsync -Pvtau $home_dir$arr/ aadi@$remote:$home_dir$arr done else for arr in $HomeArray; do rsync -Pvntau $home_dir$arr/ aadi@$remote:$home_dir$arr done fi # files in storage SArray=( &amp;#34;reading&amp;#34; &amp;#34;research&amp;#34; ) if [[ $* == *--write* ]] then for arr in $SArray; do rsync -Pvtau $storage_dir$arr/ aadi@$remote:$home_dir$arr done else for arr in $SArray; do rsync -Pvntau $storage_dir$arr/ aadi@$remote:$home_dir$arr done fi</description></item><item><title>PySpark Fill Rates</title><link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/code/pyspark-fill-rate/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 06:38:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/code/pyspark-fill-rate/</guid><description>import pyspark # missing values per column for k, v in sorted( table.agg(*[ (1 - (F.count(c) / F.count(&amp;#39;*&amp;#39;))) .alias(c + &amp;#39;_miss&amp;#39;) for c in table.columns]) .collect()[0] # retrieve all data to driver .asDict() # convert to python dictionary .items() # retrieve key-value pairs , key=lambda el: el[1] , reverse=True): print(k, v)</description></item><item><title>Unravelling `tf.einsum`</title><link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/tf-einsum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 23:00:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/tf-einsum/</guid><description>Origin Story Recently, I was trying to disect the original DCNN Paper which utilized a diffusion kernel to more readily make use of implicit graph-structure in common tasks such as node, edge and graph classification. However, an existing implementation I fonund had a curious piece of notation which led me down the rabbithole of Tensor calculus.
Coordinates are maps used to solve a given problem. A coordinate transform allows mapping from one frame of reference to another (converting from a map of your high school, to the location of your high school in reference to where it is in the city, compared to a country-wide map).</description></item><item><title>Basics of The Adjacency Matrix</title><link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/matrix-graph/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 06:20:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/matrix-graph/</guid><description>This summarizes my initial set of basic notes surrounding the adjacency matrix representation of a graph
There are multiple ways of representing graph-structured data. One of the most common ways is using the adjacency matrix, where connections between nodes are represented in a row-column format.
For example:
$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} $$</description></item><item><title>The Graph Neural Network</title><link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/graph-neural-network/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 06:38:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/graph-neural-network/</guid><description>The Graph Neural Network (GNN) was proposed (Scarselli, 2008) as a general framework for defining deep neural networks on graph data.
(If you need a refresher on deep learning, see here)
The idea was to somehow utilize a deep neural network to generate node-embeddings in a generalize-able way to graph-structured data. The main idea in utilizing neural networks was that, apart from node features (degree, attributes, etc), the actual structure of the node&amp;rsquo;s neighbourhood, and by extension the graph, should contribute somehow to the node embeddings.</description></item><item><title>Prefetching Memory in CUDA</title><link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/prefetch-cuda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/prefetch-cuda/</guid><description>Threads, Blocks and Grids A thread is a single &amp;ldquo;process&amp;rdquo; on GPU. Any given GPU kernel can use blocks of threads, grouped into a grid of blocks. A kernel is executed as a grid of blocks of threads. Each block is run by a single Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) and in most usual, single-node cases can&amp;rsquo;t be migrated to other SMs. One SM may execute several CUDA blocks concurrently.
Paging Paging is a memory-management technique which allows a process&amp;rsquo;s physical address space to be non-contiguous.</description></item></channel></rss>
