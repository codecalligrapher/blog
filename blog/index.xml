However, an existing implementation I fonund had a curious piece of notation which led me down the rabbithole of Tensor calculus.
Coordinates are maps used to solve a given problem. A coordinate transform allows mapping from one frame of reference to another (converting from a map of your high school, to the location of your high school in reference to where it is in the city, compared to a country-wide map).</description></item><item><title>Basics of The Adjacency Matrix</title><link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/matrix-graph/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 06:20:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/matrix-graph/</guid><description>This summarizes my initial set of basic notes surrounding the adjacency matrix representation of a graph
There are multiple ways of representing graph-structured data. One of the most common ways is using the adjacency matrix, where connections between nodes are represented in a row-column format.
For example:
$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} $$</description></item><item><title>The Graph Neural Network</title><link>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/graph-neural-network/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 06:38:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aadi-blogs.web.app/blog/graph-neural-network/</guid><description>The Graph Neural Network (GNN) was proposed (Scarselli, 2008) as a general framework for defining deep neural networks on graph data.
(If you need a refresher on deep learning, see here)
The idea was to somehow utilize a deep neural network to generate node-embeddings in a generalize-able way to graph-structured data. The main idea in utilizing neural networks was that, apart from node features (degree, attributes, etc), the actual structure of the node&amp;rsquo;s neighbourhood, and by extension the graph, should contribute somehow to the node embeddings.</description></item></channel></rss>
